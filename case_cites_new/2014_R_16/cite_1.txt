<><><> Heard learned counsel for the parties. These writ petitions involved following questions : -
"(i) Whether the respondent-State was justified in preparing the list of selected candidates Districtwise for the appointment to the post of GNM/Nurse Grade-II or the State should have prepared the merit list Statewise?
(ii) Whether the persons who were having more marks Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters.
in merit if the list is prepared Statewise have been denied appointment wrongly?
(iii) Whether while giving appointment to the post of GNM/Nurse Grade-II due regard was not given to the reservation policy? And lastly
(iv) Whether the persons who were selected in the Districtwise seniority and have not joined are entitled to the appointment to the post of GNM/Nurse Grade-II merely because of the reason that the writ petition of several writ petitioners have been allowed by the Jaipur Bench of this court while deciding SBCWP No.4298/2008 and connected 110 writ petitions or because of this judgment?
The brief facts which have already been taken note of in judgment delivered by Jaipur Bench of this Court in SBCWP No.4298/2008 and connected 110 writ petitions dated 15th May, 2009 may be recapitulated here:
Under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) a notification inviting applications for appointment of 2500 General Nurse and Mid Wife (GNM) in Sub-Health Centres in 24 Districts was issued. In this selection, the appointments were to be made at District level and the candidates of the respective Districts were to be given preference. Thereafter, second advertisement was issued on 8.8.2007 for 6172 GNM posts on the same terms Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters.
and conditions. On 25.8.2007 an amended notification was issued wherein it was stated that merit list will be prepared at State level. Then again on 21.1.2008 another amended notification was issued wherein it was stated that merit list will be prepared at the District level. The said order dated 21.1.2008 of District Level selection was challenged by some of the candidates and out of which one was Shri Demaram whose writ petition no.1120/2008 was allowed by the Single Bench of this Court and corrigendum dated 21.1.2008 was set aside and earlier corrigendum dated 25.8.2007 of the State level was maintained on the ground that District level selection and preference of the District will be discriminatory and no merit can be prepared at District level in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Superme Court delivered in the case of Rajesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. Vs. State of UP & Ors reported in 2005(5) SCC 172. Following the judgment of Dema Ram's case the writ petitions which were filed at Principal Seat of the High Court were also allowed by deciding several writ petitions by judgment dated 16th May, 2008. The above judgments were again followed in Santh Lal Yadav & Ors Vs. State & Ors passed in SBCWP No.741/2008 and the said judgment was also followed in respect to the appointment to the Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters.
post of ANM.
In all the aforesaid writ petitions some of the candidates have been appointed either as Nurse Grade-II/GNM/ANM prior to issuance of notification dated 4th May, 2007, but all of them have applied under advertisement dated 4th May, 2007 and 8.8.2007. These persons claimed that they are more meritorious and person lower in merit have been appointed by the respondents in the State merit list which was prepared on 28.2.2009 after issuing provisional merit list and inviting of the objections.
One of the issue raised in several writ petitions was that whether ad hoc employee can be allowed to substitute by another fresh ad hoc employee. In SBCWP No.4298/2008 after hearing the parties it has been held as under: -
"......the petitioner(s) cannot be allowed to raise the submission of substitution of adhoc employee by another fresh adhoc employee on contract basis for the simple reason that they have not challenged the advertisement at the relevant time and further they have participated in the selection process and when their name did not find place in the State merit list, they have raised the said ground. The law is well settled on the issue that having participated in the selection process, it is not open for the unsuccessful candidates/employees to challenge the same...."
So far as preparation of the merit list Districtwise is concerned, it has been held as under: -
Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters.
"As regard these particular cases, there are 3 judgments of this Court namely Dema Ram Choudhary, Dinesh Kumar and Santh Lal Yadav & Ors. to prepare the merit list on State level and I respectfully agree with the said judgments".
And further held as under: -
"As regard the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 2008(12), 1 titled as Balbir Kaur and Another Vs. U.P.Secondary Education Services Selection Board, Allahabad & Another, it has been held that unless the district wise selection proved to be discriminatory it is not per se violative of the equality principle in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Here, in the instant case the preference to the resident of the district was given in the district level selection, therefore, the same was held to be discriminatory by this Court in the judgment of Dema Ram Choudhary, Dinesh Kumar and Santh Lal Yadav & Ors."
Then Ultimately, the writ petitions were decided with following directions: -
"However, there are chances that the name of the petitioner(s) may appear in the State merit list, therefore, all the writ petition except Sharmila Paneri are disposed of with a direction to the respondents that in case the name of the petitioner(s) stand in the State merit list dated 28.02.2009 of G.N.M. and the advertised vacancies are available then they may be given appointment as per their merit even if the less meritorious persons are continuing, then they have to make room for the petitioner(s) whose name stands higher on merit in State merit list".
In some and substance the State's seniority list prepared Statewise was upheld and Districtwise seniority was declared discriminatory. Therefore, the question no.(i) framed above has Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters. already been answered by the judgment delivered in SBCWP No.4298/2008 and connected writ petitions vide judgment dated 15th May, 2009 and the Statewise seniority shall prevail.
The question no.(ii) also stand answered by the same judgment referred above and the persons who were having high marks in merit in Statewise seniority list they are entitled to be appointed above the persons who have been given appointment having less marks to the concerned petitioners.
Learned counsel for the petitioner do not press the question no.(iii) regarding their objection to the non- implementation of the reservation policy. Therefore, question no.
(iii) is decided against the petitioners.
Now the question arises whether any candidate whose name was in select list prepared Districtwise and has not joined on the post inspite of his being selected whether he is entitled to claim his right on the post on the ground that now in the seniority list prepared Statewise and in State seniority list his name has been shown at the place of his rank in merit list and therefore he is entitled to appointment. Answer is in negative because of the plain and simple reason that in process of selection if one was entitled to the job after due selection and Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters. has not joined on the post and thereby abandoned his claim to the post cannot get a new right for appointment on the post because of the reason that some judgment has been delivered in another writ petitioner's case resulting into re-preparation of the merit list. Such candidates' abandonment to the claim on the post stand concludedly abandoned with his not joining his post. At this juncture, it will be worthwhile to mention here that learned Addl. Advocate General pointed out that an order was passed by the State Government on 18th May, 2009 whereby it has been conveyed that because of the interim order passed in SBCWP No.2264/209 dated 2nd March, 2009 and because of the operation of the Code of Conduct due to General Election for Parliament the joining date for the selected candidates was extended upto 25th May, 2009 and since now the interim order passed by the Jaipur Bench of the Rajasthan High court has come to an end, therefore, the joining period for the candidates is extended from 25th May, 2009 to 8th June, 2009 and, therefore, those selected candidates who could not join the duties because of the Code of Conduct for Election now they may be permitted to join the duties. The candidates covered by the said order of the State Government dated 18th May, 2009 since Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs. State of Raj. & Ors alongwith other connected GNM matters. have not abandoned their claim and could not join the duties because of the reason beyond their control, therefore, their cases is not covered under the category of the candidates who abandoned the claim to the post and, therefore, they can be allowed to join the duties provided they are already in select list.
It has also been specifically pointed out by learned Addl. Advocate General that the select list has already been placed on the Net so that every candidate can get the complete information about his placement in the merit list prepared Statewise.
In view of the above, the candidates who are claiming that their rank is higher to any person whose names is in the select list and such candidates' name is not in the select list inspite of his being having more marks than the candidate whose name has been shown in the merit list, may submit his representation within a period of 15 days from today upon which the respondents may consider the representation and may pass appropriate orders expeditiously preferably within a period of one month thereafter.
In view of the above observations, these writ petitions are disposed of in the light of the decision given in SBCWP No.4298/2008 and connected writ petitions decided by the Smt. Randeep Kaur Vs.
